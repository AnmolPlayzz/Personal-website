<h1>FAQs</h1>

<h2>What is this</h2>
<p>This is my personal portfolio website hosted on GitHub pages. It was started as a project to learn front-end technologies and flex on others.</p>

<h2>Can I copy code from this repo?</h2>
<p>Yes! This repo is completely open source and I wouldn't mind any copying. It would be nice if you credit this repo in the README though.</p>

<h2>I found a bug, what do I do?</h2>
<p>Please open an issue <a href="https://github.com/AnmolPlayzz/AnmolPlayzz.github.io/issues">here</a> and provide details about the bug.</p>

<h2>What languages did you use to make this?</h2>
<p>I used, HTML (Short for hyper text markup language), CSS (Cascade style sheet) and JavaScript.</p>

<h2>Why not a framework?</h1>
<p>Well, at the time I started this project, I barely knew about frameworks and found it overwhelming to use frameworks.</p>
